# Use Weights and Biases on Saturn Cloud
## Welcome!

This project provides examples showing how to use  <a href="https://wandb.ai/"  target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Weights and Biases</a> in Saturn Cloud, to monitor 
the training and performance of your machine learning models. We have included single-node 
training of an image classifier, as well as a multi-node example that lets you see how nicely 
Weights and Biases can integrate with distributed training on Dask clusters. 

## [Train image classifier on single node (PyTorch)](train-pytorch-local.ipynb)

In this notebook, you'll train an image classifier with PyTorch and use Weights and Biases to
 monitor model performance.

## [Use Pytorch on a single GPU](train-pytorch-cluster.ipynb)

This notebook expands upon the image classifier training task, using a Dask cluster to accelerate
 the same task. Weights and Biases is still able to easily and clearly provide model performance monitoring.
